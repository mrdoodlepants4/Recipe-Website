      Description
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pho means rice noodles and dac biet means special in Vietnamese. So this is a special beef noodle soup. Pho dac biet typically consists of a beef broth, rice noodles, and various cuts of beef such as brisket, beef steak, and beef balls. It usually also includes other ingredients such as tripe and tendon. If you plan to include only beef like meat and beef balls, then it is called pho bo. The noodle soup is served with fresh herbs, bean sprouts, lime wedges, and chili peppers, and can be customized with additional condiments such as hoisin sauce and sriracha. Pho dac biet is a beloved dish in Vietnam and has gained popularity around the world as a flavorful and comforting meal.

      Steps
    </h4>
      <ol>
	<li>
	  <strong>Prep the protein.</strong> In order to slice the beef, chicken or pork as thinly as possible, I recommend popping the meat in the freezer for at least 30-45 minutes to chill. Then use a sharp knife to thinly slice the meat before adding it to the soup.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Make the broth.</strong> Meanwhile, as the meat is chilling, char the onion and ginger (either in a skillet or under the broiler). Meanwhile, briefly toast the spices in a large stockpot. Then add in the onion, ginger, and broth. Cover and let everything simmer together for at least 30 minutes so that all of those flavors can meld. Strain out and discard all of the onions, ginger and spices. Then stir in the remaining ingredients and season with salt.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Prep the noodles.</strong> Meanwhile, as your broth is simmering, go ahead and cook the noodles al dente according to the package instructions. Drain in a strainer, then toss briefly with cold water to prevent the noodles from continuing to cook, and set aside. (I also recommend tossing the noodles with a drizzle of oil — such as sesame oil — to prevent them from sticking.)
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Assemble.</strong> Once everything is ready to go, add a handful of noodles to each individual serving bowl, topped with your desired protein. Then ladle the simmering hot broth into the serving bowls, being sure to submerge the meat so that it will get cooked. Top with lots and lots of garnishes.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <b>Serve.</b> And serve warm, encouraging everyone to stir the garnishes into the soup so that they can flavor the broth, also adding in additional extra sauces if desired.
